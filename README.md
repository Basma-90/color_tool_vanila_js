**Description**:
The Color Manipulation Tool is a web application that allows users to interact with and adjust colors using a user-friendly interface. It provides the following features:

    1 Color Input: Users can enter a hex color code into the input field, and the tool validates and displays the color in real-time.

    2 Brightness Adjustment: A slider allows users to adjust the brightness of the color. Sliding to the right increases brightness, while sliding to the left decreases it.

    3 Toggle Functionality: The tool includes a toggle button that allows users to switch between "lighten" and "darken" modes. In "lighten" mode, the color becomes brighter, while in "darken" mode, the color becomes darker.

    4 Real-time Preview: As users interact with the slider and toggle button, the tool provides a real-time preview of the altered color, displayed in a separate area.

This Color Manipulation Tool is helpful for users who need to experiment with and fine-tune color shades quickly. It's a practical utility for designers, developers, and anyone working with colors in web and graphic design projects.
